PROJECT DESCRIPTION

BUSINESS CASE : MAIN PROBLEM & IMPACT

The dynamic and unpredictable nature of crises, which makes it difficult to anticipate the scale and nature of assistance needed in various regions
Impact :
- delays in response, 
- inefficient resource allocation, 
- inability to adequately address the evolving needs of affected populations.

METHODOLOGY & USED TOOLS
- Kinds of Data: Historical Assistance Data, Demographic and Population Data
- 2 936 people to be assisted in 4 Regions of Burkina Faso
- Categorical variables: Region, State, Commune, Household Role, Recipient, Gender, Assistance Time, Modality (Cash, Food, E-voucher)
- Numerical variables: Household Size, Age

Machine Learning Models: 
- Predictive model using Decision Tree Classifier

Used Tools :
- Python,
- Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook,
- Excel.

Most Significant Change (impact) after implementing the project:
- For the work I do
- Ability to assure Data Quality
- Realize predictive ML model
- Ability to provide advanced data solutions

For my Organization: Once the project has been implemented, it will deliver the following results :
- Estimating the number of people who will require assistance;
- Insights into the key factors and variables influencing assistance needs, which can inform future resource allocation and planning;
- Improved decision-making capabilities for providing assistance;
- Enhanced preparedness for handling future assistance requirements based on data-driven predictions.

For the Sustainable Development Goals
- Contribute to the SDG 2 â€“ Zero Hunger

Key Learnings from the fellowship and the project implementation :
- Assessment of Data Maturity
- Ability to build and train ML predictive model
- Ability to use data analytics tools to solve problems
- Improved skills in Data preprocessing, Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation and data story telling

Next Steps :
- Evaluate the performance of ML predictive model
- Design the web application with TensorFlow (Google) for predicting assistance modalities 
- Share results - recommend adoption
